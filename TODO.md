next adjustments:

1. remove Без полки as these are all READ books
2. format Прочитано: 2024-12-25 as Прочитано: 25.12.2024 and append the number of days I've spent ("Date Added" minus "Date Read") like 25.12.2024 (4 дня or 5 дней or 1 день)
3. Use russian names for author if you can (like Автор: Сергей Лукяненко instead of Автор: Sergei Lukyanenko)
4. fetch series for the books where it's available as Семь дней до Мегиддо is a part of series but it's not shown
5. add a link to the book on the site (like https://www.litres.ru/sergey-lukyanenko/sem-dney-do-megiddo/) next to the book title (with litres icon) and link to the book on goodreads (with goodreads icon) next to the book title
6. add a link to the author on the site (like https://www.litres.ru/sergey-lukyanenko/) next to the author name (with litres icon ) and link to the author on goodreads (with goodreads icon) next to the author name

=================

new adjustments:
1. change litres to livelib 
2. goodreads links are not working. we need to fix them or get the data needed for them to work
3. show currently reading book in a separate block with cover and title
4. show the number of books read in the current year    

=================

new adjustments:

1. move js to a separate file
2. remove links to  livelib (it's formed as https://www.livelib.ru/book/1005939880-predel-sergej-lukyanenko and I doubt we can guess this )
3. remove link to the author on goodreads link
4. we have "Book Id" in the data. use it to generate the link to the book on goodreads

=================

new adjustments:

1. Прочитано: 20.12.2024 (3 дней) should be 3 дня
2. Джейн Эйр  Автор: Ирина Гурова but the author name is "Charlotte Brontë" and "Ирина Гурова" in additional authors is just a translator.
3. adjust the layout for Читаю сейчас (make more compact and add more available information and also add goodreads icon link)  
4. Среднее страниц 417.1 - what does this mean? rename or change this for some another useful information
5. add interesting statistics   that we can have from our data
